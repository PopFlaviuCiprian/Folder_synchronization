- This is a simple script where 2 folders are synchronized to an given period of time and save events to a log file 
- The folder from above is the main folder where you can
copy, create, or delete files and the folder below will synchronize to every 10 seconds in our case and save every event in a log file.
- The script can be edited to synchronize multiple folders from a local network , it is good when you have multiple PC's and want to copy files from a master computer to all PC's on the network. For example it can be used by a network admin in a school to copy a directory to 'n' computers with a single click.
